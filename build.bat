:: This script will build a .NET project in Release mode, sign the generated DLLs with a provided PFX certificate,
:: package the DLLs into a NuGet package, and sign the NuGet package with the provided PFX certificate.
:: This script also handles pre-run cleanup (will delete old DLLs and NuGet package files)

:: Requirements:
:: - NuGet is installed on the machine and is accessible everywhere (added to PATH)
:: - dotnet is installed on the machine and is accessible everywhere (added to PATH) (might be in C:\Program Files\dotnet)
:: - SnInstallPfx (https://github.com/honzajscz/SnInstallPfx) is installed on the machine and is accessible everywhere (added to PATH)
